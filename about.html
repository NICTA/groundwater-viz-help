<h2>About</h2>
<p>The Groundwater Visualisation System was built to allow easy visualisation and exploration of hydrogeological models and related data alongside authoritative geospacial data.</p>
<p>This is a collaboration effort between New South Wales Office Of Water and National ICT Australia.</p>
<p>This is currently released as alpha for evaluation and feedback.</p>
<p>
  Further development is subject to industry and stakeholder needs. This system was built on top of the <a href="http://nationalmap.nicta.com.au/" target="_blank">NATIONAL MAP</a> platform.
